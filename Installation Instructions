Installation requirements. 

Installation of this module is simpel. Download the VirtualResection.py file, find the site-packages folder from Slicer and save the file in that folder.
To quickly find the correct folder you can run the following in the Python interactor: 

import numpy
numpy 

This prints out an string of the numpy location, for example: <module 'numpy' from '/Applications/Slicer.app/Contents/lib/Python/lib/python3.9/site-packages/numpy/__init__.py'>
This means that the correct installation folder would be '/Applications/Slicer.app/Contents/lib/Python/lib/python3.9/site-packages'


To use this module, please import VirtualResection into the Slicer module. Functions can be accessed by using VirtualResection.FUCNTION(), 
for example VirtualResection.Init().
